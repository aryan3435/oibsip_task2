<ul>
				<li> A.P.J. Abdul Kalam, in full
				Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam,
				was born on October 15, 1931, in
				Rameswaram, Tamil Nadu, India.</li>
				 <li>He served as the 11th President
				of India from 2002 to 2007.</li>
				<li>Kalam earned a degree in
				aeronautical engineering from the
				Madras Institute of Technology and in
				1958 joined the Defence Research and
				Development Organisation (DRDO).</li>
				<li>In 1969, he moved to the Indian
				Space Research Organisation, where he
				was project director of the SLV-III, the
				first satellite launch vehicle that was
				both designed and produced in India.</li>
				<li> Rejoining DRDO in 1982,
				Kalam planned the program that produced
				a number of successful missiles, which
				helped earn him the nickname 
				Missile Man.</li>
				<li>Among those successes
				was Agni, India’s first intermediate-range
				ballistic missile, which incorporated
				aspects of the SLV-III and was launched
				in 1989.</li>
				<li> He also played a
				pivotal organisational, technical,
				and political role in India's Pokhran-II
				nuclear tests in 1998, the first since
				the original nuclear test by India in 1974.</li>
				 <li> From 1992 to 1997 Kalam
				was scientific adviser to the defense
				minister, and he later served as principal
				scientific adviser (1999–2001) to the
				government with the rank of cabinet minister.</li>
				<li> His prominent role in
				the country’s 1998 nuclear weapons tests
				solidified India as a nuclear power and
				established Kalam as a national hero,
				although the tests caused great concern
				in the international community.</li>
				<li> In 1998 Kalam put
				forward a countrywide plan called
				Technology Vision 2020, which he described
				as a road map for transforming India from
				a less-developed to a developed society
				in 20 years. The plan called for, among
				other measures, increasing agricultural
				productivity, emphasizing technology as
				a vehicle for economic growth, and
				widening access to health care and
				education.</li>
				<li>Kalam received <b>7</b>
				honorary doctorates from <b>40</b>
				universities. The Government of India
				honoured him with the <b>Padma Bhushan
				in 1981</b> and the <b>Padma Vibhushan
				in 1990</b> for his work with ISRO and
				DRDO and his role as a scientific advisor
				to the Government.</li>
				<li> In 1997, Kalam received
				India's highest civilian honour, the
				Bharat Ratna, for his contribution to
				the scientific research and modernisation
				of defence technology in India.</li>
				<li> In 2013, he was the
				recipient of the Von Braun Award from
				the National Space Society "to recognize
				excellence in the management and leadership
				of a space-related project".</li>
				<li>While delivering a
				lecture at the Indian Institute of
				Management Shillong, Kalam collapsed and
				died from an apparent cardiac arrest on
				<b>27 July 2015</b>, aged 83.</li>
				<li> Wheeler Island, a
				national missile test site in Odisha, was
				renamed <b>Kalam Island</b> in September
				2015.</li>
				<li> A prominent road in
				New Delhi was renamed from Aurangzeb
				Road to <b>Dr APJ Abdul Kalam Road</b>
				in August 2015.</li>
				<li> In February 2018,
				scientists from the Botanical Survey
				of India named a newly found plant
				species as Drypetes kalamii, in his
				honour.
